## 1. Motivation

Financier is directed towards people who want to monitor their credit card expenses. In this code rework, I convert a formerly fully Ruby on Rails application into a rails API.

## 2. Walkthrough

Here is a look at one of the app's features: protected and unprotected pages. For security reasons, user's must log in to view their dashboard. Anyone can see the homepage, however, because it is an unprotected page.
